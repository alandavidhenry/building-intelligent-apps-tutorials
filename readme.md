## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Code from the book: Building Intelligent Apps with .NET and Azure AI Services.

I have also created Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Bicep, Terraform and Pulumi

### Built With

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb)
- [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)

#### Definitions

_.NET_: The development framework used for writing the Function App code.

_Microsoft Azure_: A cloud computing provider.

_Azure Function App_: A serverless compute service that allows you to run event-triggered code without managing infrastructure.

_Bicep_: A domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively.

_Terraform_: An open-source IaC tool that supports multiple cloud providers, including Azure.

_Pulumi_: Pulumi is an infrastructure-as-code platform that can use a general-purpose programming language for their cloud resources(such as JavaScript or Python)
